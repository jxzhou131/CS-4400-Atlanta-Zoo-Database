# CS-4400-Atlanta-Zoo-Database
In this project, we constructed a relational database using python 3.5, qt designer and mysql. The mysql servers is a remote server setup by the Georgia Institute of Technology. Thus, after this Fall 2018 semester the database might not be able to be accessed anymore.

## Project Purpose  
Analyze, specify, design, implement, document and demonstrate an online system. You are required to use the classical methodology for database development. The system will be implemented using a relational DBMS that supports standard SQL queries. The TAs will provide you with information about how to access a college-managed MySQL server in order to implement your database and the application. We will also provide you with a list of approved technologies for your implementation, and the professor must approve the use of any other alternative technologies. Under no circumstances can you use a tool that automatically generates SQL or automatically maps programming objects into the database. You also cannot use any other software like Access or SQLite. Ask the professors or TAs if you have questions about which tools/languages/software are allowed.
